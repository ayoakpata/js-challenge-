/* 
Write a function declineEverything() that takes in an array of strings and, 
using .forEach(), loops through each element in the array 
and calls politelyDecline() with each of them.

The .forEach() function should apply politelyDecline() directly; 
it should NOT merely receive argument function that uses politelyDecline().

You can test your function when youâ€™re ready by passing in the veggies array 
or by making your own array!


2.
Now we need to get healthy! Write a function acceptEverything() 
that takes in an array of strings and loops through each element 
in the array and grudgingly accepts each of them, 
by logging to the console in the following format: 
'Ok, I guess I will eat some [element].'

*/

const veggies = ['broccoli', 'spinach', 'cauliflower', 'broccoflower'];

const politelyDecline = (veg) => {
  console.log('No ' + veg + ' please. I will have pizza with extra cheese.');
};

const declineEverything = (arr) => {
  arr.forEach(politelyDecline);
};

//console.log(declineEverything(veggies))

// Checkpoint 2 solutions:
// Using an anonymous function and string interpolation:
const acceptEverything = (arr) => {
  arr.forEach((e) => {
    console.log(`Ok, I guess I will eat some ${e}.`);
  });
};

//console.log(acceptEverything(veggies))

// Using a loop:
// const acceptEverything = arr => {
//  for(let i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
//     console.log(`Ok, I guess I will eat some ${arr[i]}.`)
//  }
// }
