/*  

Given the percentage of DNA shared between two people, you can calculate their likely familial relationship.

We wrote a function, whatRelation(), that has one number parameter, 
percentSharedDNA, and returns the likely relationship. 
We expect the number passed in to always be an integer from 0 to 100, 
but for some reason it’s not working!

Here’s how it’s supposed to calculate the relationship:

100 should return 'You are likely identical twins.'
35-99 should return 'You are likely parent and child or full siblings.'
14-34 should return 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, 
or half siblings.'
6-13 should return 'You are likely 1st cousins.'
3-5 should return 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'
1-2 should return 'You are likely 3rd cousins.'
0 should return 'You are likely not related.'

*/

const whatRelation = (percentSharedDNA) => {
  if (percentSharedDNA === 100) {
    return 'You are likely identical twins.';
  } else if (percentSharedDNA >= 35 && percentSharedDNA <= 99) {
    return 'You are likely parent and child or full siblings.';
  } else if (percentSharedDNA >= 14 && percentSharedDNA <= 34) {
    return 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.';
  } else if (percentSharedDNA >= 6 && percentSharedDNA <= 13) {
    return 'You are likely 1st cousins.';
  } else if (percentSharedDNA >= 3 && percentSharedDNA <= 5) {
    return 'You are likely 2nd cousins.';
  } else if (percentSharedDNA >= 1 && percentSharedDNA <= 2) {
    return 'You are likely 3rd cousins';
  } else if (percentSharedDNA === 0) {
    return 'You are likely not related.';
  }
};

console.log(whatRelation(3));
// Should print 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'

//console.log(whatRelation(3));
// Should print 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'
